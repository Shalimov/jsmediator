# JS-Mediator

# Simple implementation of mediator pattern.

- Here you can find simple utilities (#map, #each, #extend).
- Also -> EventEmitter (#on, #off, #emit, #once)
- And of course -> Mediator (#addComponent, #removeComponent, #hasComponent, #getComponent, #etc...)

At this moment documentation in progress,
if you want to understand how it works,
you should look at the tests.
